		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p> Hello and welcome! I am Arka Prava Basu , undergraduate Computer Science student from NIT Durgapur. I have always been enthusiastic about coding and after joining college I have been attracted to software development. I use my leisure time in developing Android applications. While developing I try to think out of the box, trying to solve the problems which I face handling any computerised device. I also dive into competitive coding from time to time.  </p>
		<p> I am also an avid gamer and in a way it has attracted me in Game Development. While developing games I generally work in a team of three. As a game developer I mainly work on level designing and game AI. I am currently working in a FPS shooter game which , hopefully, will release mid next year. </p>
		<h2>Interests and Hobbies </h2>
		<p> Primary interests are coding and software development. I am enthusiastic about technology and gadgets, often spending hours reading reviews of new devices launched or watching YouTube videos about the same. My works on application development can be found under the heading App Development under Works tab. The few games which I am developing can be found under Game Development under the same tab. </p>
		<p> In my leisure time I listen to music, Nickleback being my current favourite band. While rock songs are my favourite genre I appreciate all forms of music. A Bengali cannot really stay away from football and I am an ardent football fan, Barcelona being my favourite football club. Having said that I am a very poor player and cannot say that sports is a field that I have tasted a lot. My taste of movies is limited mainly to thrillers, comic book cinemas, action and detective/mystery thrillers. </p>
